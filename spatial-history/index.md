# <span style="color:white">The Chernobyl Accident, 1986</span>
#### <span style="color:white">By: Dylan Page</span>

> On April 26, 1986, the number 4 reactor of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant exploded, releasing radioactive material into the atmosphere. It is considered to be the worst nuclear accident in history. [(Zablotska 1)](https://journals-scholarsportal-info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/details/10993460/v93i0003/407_3atcnarocdpp.xml) The disaster resulted in deaths both immediate and delayed, the contamination of thousands more, and the spread of radioactive material to nearly every country in the Northern Hemisphere. [(BBC)](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/guides/456900/456957/html/nn3page1.stm) In this paper, I will discuss the circumstances and effects of the incident and argue that the geographic location of Chernobyl played a large role in mitigating damage (both immediate and lasting) to the environment and human populations alike.

> The plant was constructed in the Ukraine (at the time a part of the U.S.S.R.) beginning in 1970. The fourth and final reactor was completed in 1983. [(world-nuclear)](http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident.aspx) It possessed four reactors of the same design, all constructed to harness the heat from controlled reactions of radioactive material. The heat was used to create steam, which in turn spun turbines and created electrical power. At the time of the accident, the plant was undergoing a test for its ability to operate in the event of a blackout. Due to both engineering deficiencies and faulty actions of the plant's operators (notably the disabling of emergency safety systems), the heat caused by the unchecked and overpowered reaction weakened critical structural components, which in turn released pressurized coolant water that flashed into steam and exploded, releasing any remaining liquid coolant. [(UNSCEAR, Annex J, s.1, par. 10)](http://www.unscear.org/docs/publications/2000/UNSCEAR_2000_Annex-J.pdf) The release of coolant within the reactor allowed the fuel to increase reactivity without impediment, partially vaporizing itself and components of the core; the rapidly-expanding fuel vapor caused yet another explosion which destroyed much of the building and spread fuel and other components onto nearby buildings and the surrounding area. [(ibid par.11)](http://www.unscear.org/docs/publications/2000/UNSCEAR_2000_Annex-J.pdf) Subsequent fires and efforts to mitigate the spread of radioactive material released that very material into the atmosphere.

> The proximity of some plant and emergency workers to the site resulted in 134 cases of acute radiation syndrome and 28 deaths in the following months. [(Wakeford 1)](https://journals-scholarsportal-info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/details/09524746/v36i0002/e1_cafawn.xml) In addition, the atmospheric travel of radioactive particles to nearby regions directly affected the increase of cancer, particularly thyroid cancer in children under 15 at the time (due to the radiosensitivity of the thyroid gland). As time passed and the children aged, an irregular number of diagnosed cases was observed, particularly in Belarus, which received much of the contaminants. [(UNSCEAR, Annex J, s.V, par.263)](http://www.unscear.org/docs/publications/2000/UNSCEAR_2000_Annex-J.pdf) However, over 30 years since the accident, the area around the plant is now a legal tourist attraction. The nearby ghost town of _Pripyat_, which housed plant workers and their families, remains uninhabited. Immediately after the disaster, a 30km area around the plant was established. It became known as the Exclusion Zone – but it also contained an area of 10km around the disaster site. This area contains more radiation and related hazards, due to its proximity to ground zero.

> Although undoubtedly a disaster, the relatively remote location of Chernobyl helped to mitigate the consequences of its destruction. If the plant were located closer to a populated city, the spread of radioactive material would have likely contaminated many more nearby citizens. The requirement in that instance to evacuate an urban region would prove to be a logistical nightmare and therefore a slow process. As can be seen by the sheer size of the exclusion zone, the threat of a nuclear reactor exploding and spreading radioactive material into the atmosphere was (and still is) a very real threat and concern. Were that 30km zone placed closer to Kiev, any statistics of medical effects both immediate and delayed would likely be massively inflated. Whether or not the Soviet’s placement of the plant some distance away from Kiev was a passive safety precaution is unknown. If Chernobyl was located closer to Moscow, for instance, then the vast majority of Soviet leadership would have been endangered and evacuated. The entire tide of the Cold War could have been affected by incompetence in both engineering and procedure. The use and application of nuclear science for non-military purposes was a positive consequence of atomic research during the Second World War, though it was clearly not absent from risk after the methods and relevant construction demands were met.
